# Using Github to Host a Website

## Overview

This repo is an example of how you can host a website using *Github*. Feel free to *clone* it to create a starting point for your own place on the 'World Wide Web' or take a look at this site in your browser to see how it renders - [numb3r17.github.io](numb3r17.github.io)

## ToDo

Next we'll see if we can add a little more to it than the customary 'Hello World!', nothing wrong with that but now we've said hello we should really say something else to keep people interested.

### Favicon

Can we set our own favicon?

### Landing Page

Can we create a landing page?

### Add Style

How about a little CSS?
